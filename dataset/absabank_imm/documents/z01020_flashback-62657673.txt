Is Sweden really so bad as some want us to believe?
I apologise for not speaking Swedish, but I am a bit curious about other countries and espeically of their political system and culture. I am college student from Croatia and need to make a seminar on Sweden. So, there is not many English based sources on swedish political culture, with the exception of "The New Totalitarians" of Roland Huntford. The news article are often also sound very unrealistic and bizzare. So one of the recent news is that Swedish PM want to make a law in which a written contract is needed to have sexual intercourse (.
) and.
claims a man was prosecuted for eating bacon.
I personally have hard to believe all of this, so how true is it?.
