id
A unique number for a span.

irony
Marked if at least half of sentiment voters thought this was irony.

target
ID of the span describing the thing someone has an opinion of.

source
ID of the span describing the person who has an opinion.

partof
ID of the span describing something which the current span's referent is a part of. A person might for example be part of an organisation.

refersto
ID of the anaphor referent of the current span. For example, a pronoun might refer to a name or other noun phrase.
